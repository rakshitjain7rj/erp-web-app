# AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER NAME FIX

## Problem Description
The customer names in the dyeing order page were showing as "Customer: [Party Name]" which was still too similar to the party name values, causing confusion for users.

## Aggressive Solution Implemented
We've implemented a much more aggressive approach to ensure customer names are completely distinct from party names:

1. **In `mapToSimplifiedDisplay` function:**
   - We now generate completely unique customer names like: `End Customer for Order #123 (Party Name)`
   - This includes both the record ID and the party name for context, but makes it visually very distinct

2. **In `mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay` function:**
   - Similar approach with format: `End Customer for Product #123 (Party Name)`
   - This ensures complete distinction between customer and party

3. **In `fetchCountProducts` function:**
   - We use the same format when processing products from the API
   - This ensures consistency across all data sources

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Complete Visual Distinction**: The customer names now have a completely different format from party names
2. **Includes Context**: We still include the party name in parentheses for reference
3. **ID-Based Uniqueness**: The inclusion of the ID ensures each customer name is truly unique
4. **Consistent Format**: The same format is used across all data processing functions
5. **Clear Purpose Indicator**: The "End Customer for..." prefix clearly indicates what the field represents

## Usage Notes
- This fix is applied automatically whenever customer names are missing or identical to party names
- Existing customer names that are already distinct from party names are preserved
- The fix is applied at all levels of data flow (API, mapping, display)

## Code Changes
Files modified:
- `src/pages/DyeingOrders.tsx`
  - Modified `mapToSimplifiedDisplay` function
  - Modified `mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay` function
  - Modified `fetchCountProducts` function

## Verification
You can verify the fix is working by:
1. Opening the dyeing order page
2. Checking that customer names now appear as "End Customer for Order/Product #ID (Party Name)"
3. Confirming that they are visually very distinct from party names
