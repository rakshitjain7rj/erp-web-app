# Production@100% Field Removal

## Summary
This document describes the changes made to remove the Production@100% input field from the Daily Production form and other parts of the UI, as requested. The field is still present in the database and used for calculations, but is no longer visible to users.

## Changes Made

1. **DailyProduction.tsx**
   - Removed the Production@100% field display in the machine info section
   - Kept the functionality intact - the field is still used in backend calculations

2. **MachineManager.tsx**
   - Removed Production@100% column header from the machines table
   - Removed the input field from the machine editing interface
   - Kept the data storage and calculation functionality intact

3. **MachineFormModal.tsx**
   - Removed Production@100% input field from the machine creation form
   - Set a default value (400) that will be used when creating new machines

## Technical Notes

- The `productionAt100` property is still maintained in the data structures and API calls
- The default value of 400 is used for new machines
- The field is still used in backend calculations for production efficiency
- Error handling for the missing `machine_configurations` table was already implemented in `asuUnit1Api.ts`

## Benefits

- Simplified user interface
- Reduced user confusion
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data
- Preserved calculation functionality

## Future Considerations

If the Production@100% field needs to be re-added in the future, the commented sections in the code can be restored.
