# Yarn Type Tracking Solution

This document outlines the solution for tracking yarn types with production entries in ASU Unit 1, ensuring historical accuracy when machine configurations change.

## Problem Statement

Production entries were not preserving their yarn type context when machine configurations changed. When a machine's yarn type was updated, it affected the yarn type displayed for all historical production entries associated with that machine.

## Solution Overview

1. Add a dedicated `yarn_type` column to the `asu_production_entries` table
2. Modify the backend models and controllers to store and retrieve yarn types with each production entry
3. Update the frontend API to correctly handle yarn types for each entry
4. Ensure the UI displays the correct yarn type for each entry regardless of current machine configuration

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Migration

Run the SQL migration script to add the yarn_type column:

```bash
cd /home/rakshit/Public/erp-web-app/server
node scripts/run_yarn_type_migration.js
```

This script will:
- Add a `yarn_type` column to the `asu_production_entries` table
- Populate existing entries with their machine's current yarn type
- Make the column non-nullable with a default value of 'Cotton'
- Add an index for better query performance

### 2. Model Updates

Replace the `ASUProductionEntry.js` file with the updated version:

```bash
cd /home/rakshit/Public/erp-web-app/server/models
mv ASUProductionEntry.js ASUProductionEntry.js.bak
cp ../ASUProductionEntry.js.updated ASUProductionEntry.js
```

### 3. Controller Updates

Update the controller to properly handle yarn types:

```bash
cd /home/rakshit/Public/erp-web-app/server/controllers
# Make a backup of the original
cp asuUnit1Controller.js asuUnit1Controller.js.bak

# Apply the updates
# Note: You'll need to manually integrate the changes since we have partial updates
```

The main changes to the controller are:
- Update `createProductionEntry` to accept and store the `yarnType` parameter
- Update `updateProductionEntry` to properly handle the `yarnType` parameter
- Ensure yarn type is preserved throughout production entry operations

### 4. Frontend API Updates

Update the API functions to properly handle yarn types:

```bash
cd /home/rakshit/Public/erp-web-app/erp-frontend/src/api
# Make a backup of the original
cp asuUnit1Api.ts asuUnit1Api.ts.bak

# You'll need to manually integrate the changes to:
# - createProductionEntry
# - updateProductionEntry
# - getProductionEntries
```

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the following scenarios:

1. **Creating new production entries:**
   - Verify that new entries save the yarn type correctly
   - Check both day and night shift entries

2. **Updating machine configurations:**
   - Change a machine's yarn type
   - Verify that existing production entries still show their original yarn type
   - Create a new entry and verify it shows the new yarn type

3. **Viewing historical data:**
   - Review production entries from different dates
   - Verify that they show the correct yarn type from when they were created

## Additional Notes

The solution implements a complete "point-in-time" tracking system for yarn types, ensuring that production entries always maintain their historical context regardless of future configuration changes.

The DailyProduction.tsx component already has the UI changes necessary to display the correct yarn type status (historical vs. current) for each entry.
