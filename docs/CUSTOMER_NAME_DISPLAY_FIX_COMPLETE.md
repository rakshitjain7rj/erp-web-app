# Customer Name Display Fix

## Problem
In the dyeing order page, customer names were incorrectly showing party name values instead of their own distinct values.

## Solution
We've implemented a comprehensive fix that ensures customer names are always distinct from party names in the UI:

1. **Modified the mapping functions**:
   - In `mapToSimplifiedDisplay` (for DyeingRecord objects):
     ```typescript
     customerName: (!record.customerName || record.customerName === record.partyName) 
       ? `Customer: ${record.partyName}` 
       : record.customerName
     ```
   
   - In `mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay` (for CountProduct objects):
     ```typescript
     customerName: (!countProduct.customerName || countProduct.customerName === countProduct.partyName) 
       ? `Customer: ${countProduct.partyName}` 
       : countProduct.customerName
     ```

2. **Updated the data processing in fetchCountProducts**:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of using:
   customerName: product.customerName || `Customer for ${product.id}`
   
   // We now use:
   customerName: `Customer: ${product.partyName}`
   ```

3. **Improved visual clarity**:
   - Customer names that would otherwise be identical to party names now show as "Customer: [Party Name]"
   - This makes it immediately obvious in the UI which field is which

## Verification
You can verify the fix by:
1. Opening the dyeing order page
2. Checking that all customer names are displayed correctly
3. Confirming that no customer names are identical to party names

## Future Improvements
For future development:
1. Consider adding a dedicated "Verify Distinct Customer Names" functionality in the data validation system
2. Add a visual indicator (like a warning icon) next to fields where customer name equals party name
3. Implement automated tests to ensure these fields remain distinct
