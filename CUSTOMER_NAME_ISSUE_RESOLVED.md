# FINAL CUSTOMER NAME ISSUE RESOLUTION

## PROBLEM SOLVED
The customer name issue has been completely resolved by removing ALL transformations, fallbacks, and modifications throughout the codebase.

## CHANGES MADE

### 1. DyeingOrders.tsx - mapToSimplifiedDisplay function
- BEFORE: Applied transformations and fallbacks
- AFTER: Direct assignment: `customerName: record.customerName`

### 2. DyeingOrders.tsx - mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay function  
- BEFORE: Applied transformations and fallbacks
- AFTER: Direct assignment: `customerName: countProduct.customerName`

### 3. DyeingOrders.tsx - handleEdit function
- BEFORE: Applied transformations during edit initialization
- AFTER: Direct assignment: `customerName: record.customerName`

### 4. DyeingOrders.tsx - handleCountProductEditSuccess function

- AFTER: Direct assignment: `customerName: updatedProduct.customerName`

### 5. DyeingOrders.tsx - fetchCountProducts function

## CURRENT STATE

## VERIFICATION

3. Verify customer name displays exactly as entered
4. No modifications should occur at any step
