# PRESERVE USER INPUT FOR CUSTOMER NAMES

## Problem Description
Customer names in the dyeing order page were being transformed, showing values like "End Customer for Order #87 (Party Name)" instead of the actual value entered by the user in the form.

## Solution Implemented
We've implemented a simple approach that preserves exactly what the user entered in the form:

1. **In `mapToSimplifiedDisplay` function:**
   - Removed all logic that modified the customer name
   - Now displays exactly the value that was entered: `customerName: record.customerName || ""`
   - No transformations or fallbacks to party name

2. **In `mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay` function:**
   - Similar approach: `customerName: countProduct.customerName || ""`
   - Preserves exactly what was entered in the form

3. **In `fetchCountProducts` function:**
   - Removed all logic that modified customer names
   - Returns products exactly as received from the API

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **True Data Preservation**: What the user enters in the form is exactly what they see in the UI
2. **Simplicity**: No complex transformations or conditional logic
3. **Predictability**: Behavior is straightforward and easy to understand
4. **User Control**: Gives users full control over what appears in the customer name field

## Usage Notes
- Empty customer names will appear as empty in the UI (no fallbacks)
- If a user enters the same value for customer name and party name, that's what will be displayed
- The form still shows a warning when customer name equals party name, but doesn't force a change

## Code Changes
Files modified:
- `src/pages/DyeingOrders.tsx`
  - Modified `mapToSimplifiedDisplay` function
  - Modified `mapCountProductToSimplifiedDisplay` function
  - Modified `fetchCountProducts` function

## Verification
You can verify the fix is working by:
1. Opening the dyeing order page
2. Checking that customer names appear exactly as entered in the form
3. Creating a new order with a specific customer name and verifying it appears unchanged
