# Production@100% Field Fix

## Problem

The ASU Unit 1 Daily Production form was having issues with the Production@100% field:

1. The field was editable by users, causing inconsistent values
2. The backend was expecting a valid productionAt100 value but sometimes couldn't find it
3. There was an error about "relation 'machine_configurations' does not exist"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Production@100% Field from Daily Production Form

- Completely removed the field from the UI
- Production@100% value now comes automatically from machine configuration
- Users no longer see or interact with this field at all

### 2. Added Helper Functions

- Created `getProductionAt100` helper to standardize how we get this value
- Updated code to always use the machine configuration's value
- Added fallback default value (400) for when the machine has no value set

### 3. Improved API Handling

- Modified `createProductionEntry` to always prioritize machine configuration values
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Made the code more resilient to missing or invalid values
- **NEW**: Added specific handling for "relation 'machine_configurations' does not exist" error
  - Production entries can now be created even without the machine_configurations table
  - Frontend gracefully handles this backend error without interrupting the user workflow

### 4. Created Database Migration

A migration file (`add_machine_configurations_table.sql`) has been created to:
- Add the missing machine_configurations table
- Create necessary indexes and constraints
- Set up a trigger to automatically save machine config with production entries
- Populate the table with existing machine data

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the database migration:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f add_machine_configurations_table.sql
   ```

2. Restart the server to apply the frontend changes.

## Future Improvements

1. Add a machine configuration management UI
2. Allow authorized users to update default production@100% values per machine
3. Add historical reporting to track changes in machine configurations over time
