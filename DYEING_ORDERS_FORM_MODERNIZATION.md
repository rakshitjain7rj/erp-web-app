## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Form Validation Logic**
```typescript
// Required fields
- quantity > 0
- customerName (non-empty)
- sentToDye > 0
- sentDate (valid date)
- partyNameMiddleman (non-empty)

// Business logic
- sentToDye ≤ quantity
- received ≤ sentToDye  
- dispatch ≤ received
- receivedDate required if received > 0
- dispatchDate required if dispatch > 0
```

### **Data Mapping (Edit Mode)**
```typescript
// DyeingRecord → SimplifiedDyeingOrderData
{
  quantity: record.quantity,
  customerName: record.partyName,
  sentToDye: record.quantity,
  sentDate: record.sentDate,
  received: 0, // Default
  receivedDate: record.arrivalDate || "",
  dispatch: 0, // Default
  dispatchDate: "",
  partyNameMiddleman: "Direct Supply" // Default
}
```
