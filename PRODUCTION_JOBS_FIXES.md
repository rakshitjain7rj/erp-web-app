# Production Jobs Section - Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Missing Navigation Link**
- **Problem**: Production Jobs route was in App.tsx but missing from Navbar.tsx
- **Fix**: Added Production Jobs link to the navigation menu in Navbar.tsx
- **Access**: Available for admin, manager, and operator roles

### 2. **Role Management**
- **Problem**: "operator" role was not included in role switching options
- **Fix**: Added "operator" to getRoleOptions() function
- **Access**: Operators can now access Production Jobs and Dashboard

### 3. **Route Organization**
- **Problem**: Statistics route was placed after /:id routes, causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Moved `/stats` route before `/:id` routes in productionRoutes.js

### 4. **Model Associations**
- **Problem**: Model associations were not properly initialized
- **Fix**: Added model association setup in server/index.js
